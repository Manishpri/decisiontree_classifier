# Decision-Tree-Classifier

A Decision Tree Classifier model implemented in python. The sklearn.tree library is used to import the DecisionTreeClassifier class. The object of the class is created and passed the following arguments:
 - criterion = 'entropy'
 - random_state = 0

All other arguments used in the classifier object are default values provied by the class.

The classifier is fitted with the X_Train and Y_Train dataset. The confusion matrix is created to test the accuracy of the model.
